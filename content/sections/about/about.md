I'm a Graduate Student in <u>Los Angeles, California</u>. My major is in Computer Engineering.
<br>
<br>
I also work as a Web Developer at <u>California State University, Northridge</u>. What excited me the most is being able to design things I like and then being able to develop them for people to use!

Below is some of my work, feel free to look around.
